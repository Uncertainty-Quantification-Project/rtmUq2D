      -- brute stacked seismic section: summation of the information in the files in the folder "TEMPORARY_FILES"
         "crossCorrelation_000001.bin" + "crossCorrelation_000002.bin" + ...
         This process provides a final stacked section that constains information about
         all shots related to a velocity field.
      
      -- filtered stacked seismic section: this file contains the result of applying the 
         Laplacian filter after the summation described earlier.
         This process provides a final stacked section that constains information about
         all shots related to a velocity field.

Observation 1:
      
      Each seismic section is a binary file with Nx * Nz information.
      See 0_inputs_readme.INFO to get information about Nx and Nz values.
      
      Each sample of the migrated section represents the seismic amplitude of hydrostatic pressure squared.
